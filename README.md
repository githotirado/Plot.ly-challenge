Belly Button Biodiversity dashboarding

This exercise took a catalog of microbial species that have been known to reside in the human belly button.  Each species is given an OTU (operational taxonomic unit) for the purposes of cataloguing.

# Observations
Mainly the bubble chart displayed the distribution of all of the species.  A relative few were very prevalent in the human belly button as indicated by the very large size of the data points.  The majority of other species were present but more rare in appearance as noted by their much smaller sphere points.

# Technical Notes
The dashboard by default draws data from the first name ID in the samples data.  ID 940 sample and demographic data are displayed by default.  A user may select another ID from the drop down menu, and the dashboard will update the demographic as well as the bubble, gauge, and bar charts.  The tool tips on the bars and bubble charts help to identify the samples, and the wash frequency helps determine what the cleaning regimen had been for the particular belly button.
